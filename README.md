# Budget Sales Analysis

## Project overview.

Domain: Retail & Sales
Project Level: Advanced
Technologies Used: Python, Tableau, Power BI

This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing sales data in relation to budget forecasts. The aim is to uncover key metrics, variances, and significant relationships between different attributes (such as products and customers) while building a comprehensive dashboard to support insights and informed decision-making.

## Problem Statment

Objective: Extract and analyze sales data in comparison to budget forecasts.

Key Goals:

* Identify and visualize key metrics, variances, and significant relationships between attributes.
* Create a dashboard to deliver insights and aid in decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about budgeted and actual sales for various products in different regions. It includes data on product name, region, month, budgeted sales, and actual sales. The dataset was obtained from an internal sales database and downloaded from online source.

## Visualizations

__Missing Data Visualization__ : A bar plot shows the percentage of missing data in each column of the merged dataset, highlighting which columns need to be cleaned or dropped.

### Pie Charts:

__Gender Distribution__: A pie chart illustrates the proportion of male vs. female customers.
__Marital Status Distribution__: Another pie chart shows the distribution of married and single customers.
__Country Distribution__: A pie chart visualizes the customer base's geographic distribution across different countries.
__Sales Distribution by Gender__: A pie chart shows how much sales revenue is generated by male vs. female customers.

### Bar Plots:

__Customer Count by Education Level__: A bar plot displays the number of customers categorized by their education levels, helping to understand the dominant educational background.
__Sales Amount by Occupation__: A bar plot highlights total sales generated by different customer occupations.
__Sales Amount by Commute Distance__: This bar plot analyzes how far customers typically travel to purchase and the sales associated with each distance group.
__Product SubCategory Sales__: A bar plot breaks down sales by product subcategories, indicating which products perform better.
__Average Sales by Education Level__: A bar plot shows the average sales amount per customer, broken down by education levels, useful for understanding spending patterns.

### Line Plots:

__Yearly Sales Performance__: This line plot shows how sales have trended over the years, emphasizing growth points.
__Monthly Sales Trend__: A line plot tracking monthly sales to detect patterns such as seasonality or promotional effects.

### Scatter Plot:

__Sales Amount vs. Order Quantity by Category__: A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between order quantities and sales amounts, segmented by product category.
__Correlation Heatmap__: The correlation heatmap visualizes the relationships between numeric variables in the dataset, offering insights into how different metrics like sales amount, order quantity, and income are related.

__Bar Plot for Income Group Sales__: This bar plot categorizes customers by income group and shows the sales amount generated by each, revealing which income segments contribute the most.

### Stacked Bar Plot:

__Average Sales by Gender and Marital Status__: A stacked bar plot analyzes the interaction between gender and marital status on average customer spending.


## Conclusion

The analysis sheds light on budget sales data and emphasizes the value of comparative analysis in pinpointing areas for improvement. The visualizations reveal key patterns and trends, aiding in making well-informed decisions. Power BI proves to be a robust tool for data analysis and visualization, allowing the creation of dynamic, interactive reports that are easy to share and collaborate on.
